<h1> Aiki </h1>

The connecting scripting language Aiki. The scripting language was a school project but turned into<br />
a hobby exercise for compiler development. In the foreseeable future it will not be applicable on all <br />
grounds in other terms of real world application, it was just a fun project.<br /><br />
Aiki aimed to be integrated easily with C++. The syntax is similar to that from Java. Unlike the language Java the Aiki is developed with ease of use from the command line while also utilizing precompiled binaries.

<br /> <br />
<h2>Portability <h2>
Aiki will run on a several of platforms eventually. But for now it is only tested on Windows & Linux. <br />
It will probably work without and trouble on OS X.
